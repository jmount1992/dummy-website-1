Hi, I am a dummy website. Congrats, we are well on our way!

This website was created by:

1. Installing Ruby and Jekyll following the instructions [here](jekyllrb.com/docs/installation).
2. Following the quick start Jekyll guide [here](jekyllrb.com/docs/)
3. Altering the `_config.yml`, `index.markdown`, and `gemfile` files created as part of the quick start.
    - To see what they were changed to visit the [repository](github.com/jmount1992/dummy-website-1)
    - If you get an error at some point about `Bundler found conflicting requirements for the Ruby version:`, delete the `Gemfile.lock` file and run `bundle install`
4. Creating a GitHub Repository and pushing the files to the remote.
5. In the GitHub repository settings, navigated to Pages (sidebar) to pages, and under `Build and Deployment`:
    1. Set Source to: `Deploy from a branch`
    2. Set Branch to: `main` and left the directory to `/(root)`
    3. Clicked save

Website is now live!
