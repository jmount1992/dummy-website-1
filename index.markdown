Hi, I am a dummy website. Congrats, we are well on our way!

This website was created by:

1. Installing Ruby and Jekyll following the instructions [here](jekyllrb.com/docs/installation).
2. Following the quick start Jekyll guide [here](jekyllrb.com/docs/)
3. Altering the `_config.yml` and `index.markdown` files created as part of the quick start.
4. Creating a GitHub Repository and pushing the files to the remote.
5. In the GitHub repository settings, navigated to Pages (sidebar) to pages, and under `Build and Deployment`:
    1. Set Source to: `Deploy from a branch`
    2. Set Branch to: `main` and left the directory to `/(root)`
    3. Clicked save
